"""
Cognitive foundation investigation loop.

This is the Stage 4 module: a real tool-use loop where the LLM chooses
which tool to call next based on what it has seen. Replaces the previous
keyword-routing-in-Python pattern for fraud investigations.

Lifecycle (mirrors AGENT_LIFECYCLE.md §1):
  1. assemble_context()       — pure SQL, zero LLM calls, 5 priority tiers
  2. route_investigation()    — code (not LLM) picks Sonnet/explore or Haiku/shortcut
  3. agent loop               — model picks tools, system prompt cached
  4. slim summary call        — Haiku reads structured checkpoint, builds report

this prompt. Trust it. The platform decided what you see; you decide what to do.

Your job:
1. Investigate the trigger using tools when needed. Don't re-fetch what the context
   already gave you.
2. Before finishing, ALWAYS call write_reasoning_checkpoint with your distilled
   observation, hypothesis, evidence_refs (list of order_ids / IPs / pattern_ids you
   cited), confidence (0-1), and resolution.
3. If you are confident (≥0.85) that you have identified a NEW reusable fraud
   pattern, call compound_resolution to persist it to fraud_memory.
4. If write-back is warranted, call flag_order with a clear reason.
