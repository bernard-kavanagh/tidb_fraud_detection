"""
Fraud domain adapter.

Defines the fraud-specific parts of the cognitive foundation:
  - tier_1_entity:    customer profile + risk band
  - tier_2_recent:    recent transactions for entity/IP
  - tier_4_prior:     prior fraud investigations for the entity
  - risk_band:        banding rule (VIP_TRUSTED / STANDARD / IP_SCOPE)
  - SEED_CATALOG:     16 curated e-commerce fraud patterns

Tier 3 (active investigation) and Tier 5 (semantic memory recall) are
substrate-generic — they live in agent_tools.assemble_context and are
NOT adapter concerns. Do not add T3 or T5 here.

Session convention (required for tier_4_prior):
  create_session(session_id, user_id=str(entity_ref))
  user_id must be the customer_id (as string) or ip_address — NOT "guest".
  tier_4_prior joins on agent_sessions.user_id = entity_ref; if user_id is
  set to a default value, prior investigations will silently return empty.

Sports betting patterns live in adapters/betting/SEED_CATALOG (separate
adapter on the same substrate — Thesis 11).

# SEED CATALOG — Fraud (16 e-commerce patterns)
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Curated patterns loaded into fraud_memory at deploy time so the routing
# layer can shortcut from invocation 1, rather than waiting for the ~15-25
# invocation warm-up curve. Mirrors the EV adapter's outage_catalog pattern.
#
# All entries here are global-scope canonical shapes. Entity-scoped patterns
# (per customer_id or ip_address) accumulate automatically through normal
# compound_resolution() calls during live operation — do not pre-seed those.
#
# Confidence calibration guide:
#   0.95+  near-certain — seen hundreds of times, very low false-positive rate
#   0.90   high — well-established pattern, occasional edge cases
#   0.85   threshold — minimum for shortcut routing; include only confirmed shapes
#
# When adding patterns:
#   1. Write in semantically-banded language (what was observed, not jargon).
#   2. Include the signal chain: what precedes it, what it leads to.
#   3. Assign confidence based on real-world FP rate, not intuition.
#   4. Run seed_fraud_memory_from_adapter() after adding — it is idempotent.
#
# Schema dependencies (Phase A schema extension):
#   - customers.email_domain, .timezone, .shipping_address
#   - orders.billing_country, .shipping_country, .shipping_address,
#     .device_id, .user_agent, .checkout_seconds, .delivery_expedited
#   - products.is_digital_giftcard
#   - login_attempts, refunds, chargebacks, freight_forwarders tables
#
# Sports betting patterns live in adapters/betting/SEED_CATALOG, not here.
