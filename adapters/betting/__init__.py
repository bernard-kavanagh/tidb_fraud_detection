"""
Betting domain adapter.

Second proof of Thesis 11 — the pattern is generic, the domain is a plugin.
Same substrate (assemble_context, routing, custodial duties, agent loop) is
reused as-is; only the tier callables, banding, and seed catalog change.

Defines:
  - tier_1_entity:   bettor profile + (placeholder) risk band
  - tier_2_recent:   recent bets for entity/IP
  - tier_4_prior:    prior betting investigations for the entity
  - risk_band:       placeholder banding rule (betting has no VIP tier today)
  - SEED_CATALOG:    three canonical betting fraud patterns

Session convention (same as fraud adapter): create_session() must be called
with user_id=str(entity_ref) for tier_4_prior to surface prior runs.
